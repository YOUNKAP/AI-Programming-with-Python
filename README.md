# AI Programming with Python Project

## Project 1 : Use pretrained Image Classifier

Using  an already developed Python classifier to predict dogs.
This code test my python skills


## Project 2 : Image Classifier

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program.
In this project, I first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
